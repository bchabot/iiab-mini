# Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) MINI

[Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)](https://internet-in-a-box.org) is a “learning hotspot” that brings the Internet's crown jewels
(Wikipedia in any language, thousands of Khan Academy videos, zoomable OpenStreetMap, electronic books, WordPress journaling, “Toys from Trash” electronics projects, ETC) to those without Internet.

This is a MINI version of that, scaled down for more generic use.
